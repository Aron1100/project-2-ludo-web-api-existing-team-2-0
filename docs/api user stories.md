# User stories for the Ludo Game API

## As a user of the API I want to be able to:

* create the game
* create multiple games
* add player(s)
* start the game
* roll the dice
* move pieces
* see the information about player's pieces' positions
* see who the current player is so that I can see if it is my turn
* list all of the games
* be able to win
* I want the game to stop if someone won.
